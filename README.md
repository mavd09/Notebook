Here you can find implementations for some classic algorithms, data structures, math and some other things that are very useful in programming competitions. 
Be free to use them and share possible improvements or mistakes. If you want you can help us with more implementations of missing algorithms that are from your perspective are important.
Enjoy them and happy coding!.

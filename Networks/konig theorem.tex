\begin{itemize}
  \item In any bipartite graph, the number of edges in a maximum matching is equal to the number of vertices in a minimum vertex cover.
  \item The complement of a vertex cover in any graph is an independent set, so a minimum vertex cover is complementary to a maximum independent set.
\end{itemize}
